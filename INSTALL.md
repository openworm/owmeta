Installation
============
Typically the steps below should be sufficient for a successful install:

    git clone https://github.com/openworm/PyOpenWorm.git --recursive
    cd PyOpenWorm
    python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can use [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html):

    pip install pyopenworm
    
However, some users have experienced difficulty installing on Mac OSX. If the install
fails when attempting to install lxml, you might try installing it separately before
attempting to install PyOpenWorm. At least one user has found this [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19548011/cannot-install-lxml-on-mac-os-x-10-9)
post to be helpful.

Optional
--------
There is an optional database storeage option called Sleepycat. You may encounter these issues if you pursue this option:

If your system does not come with bsddb, you will need to install it. On MacOSX, you can follow 
[these instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16003224/installing-bsddb-package-python) for how to install 
the python library.

If you don't have the Berkeley DB (necessary for using bsddb) you can get it from the [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index-085366.html).

    
Uninstall
----------

    pip uninstall PyOpenWorm

Running tests
-------------

After checking out the project, tests can be run on the command line with::

    python tests/test.py
