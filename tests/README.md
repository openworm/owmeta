PyOpenWorm Tests
================

Run tests by executing the following from your command line.
  $ py.test

This directory contains the unit and integration tests for PyOpenWorm.

The main test file is test.py.  

test.py itself contains many tests, but also imports tests from additional files
in this directory:

* ConfigureTest.py - Tests for the Configure class, which provides
  functionality to modules to allow outside objects to parameterize their
  behavior
* DataIntegrityTest.py - Integration tests that read from the database and
  ensure that basic queries have expected answers, as a way to keep data quality
  high.
* DatabaseBackendTest.py - Integration tests that ensure basic functioning of
  the database backend and connection
* ExampleRunnerTest.py - Runs the examples to make sure we didn't break the API
  for them.
* QuantityTest.py - Tests our Quantity class, which is used for defining things
  with measurement units
* RDFLibTest.py - Tests RDFLib, our backend library that interfaces with the
  database as an RDF graph.

In addition, there are other files in this directory:

* integration_test.py - Apparently orphaned test class.  TODO: Integrate this guy

The .conf files in this directory are used to put different configuration
parameters into different tests.  

* test_default.conf
* test_ZODB.conf
* testl.conf

Some key configuration variables that can be used include:

To change to a sparql_endpoint backend:

rdf.source = "sparql_endpoint"
rdf.store_conf = ["http://107.170.133.175:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/test","http://107.170.133.175:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/test/statements"]

To change to a sleepycat backend:

"rdf.store" : "Sleepycat",
"rdf.store_conf" : "testl.db",
"rdf.upload_block_statement_count" : 50,

* test_data.py -- this is a python file that is acting as test data.

Test data is located in the test_data directory:

* test_data/PVDR.nml.rdf.xml - Sample data in TriG format to demonstrate we can
  parse it.
* test_data/bad_test.conf - Sample .conf file for a test that ensures corrupt
  configuration files will not load (in ConfigureTest)
