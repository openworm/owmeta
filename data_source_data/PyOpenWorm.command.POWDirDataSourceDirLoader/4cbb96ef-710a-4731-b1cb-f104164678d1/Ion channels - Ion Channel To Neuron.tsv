Spreadsheet produced by S. Larson for OpenWorm (http://openworm.org).  Performs very basic text matching to discover statements that contain neuron names and abbreviations to begin to assign correspondance between channels and neurons.  Original source is WormBase expression pattern statements.  Not definitive in any way, but a starting point to produce this map.  More can be done to add classifications to neurons and to assign a relationship if the text mentions the class of the neuron instead of just the name or the abbreviation.  Currently a 1 is assigned if the individual neuron name is found OR if the name of the neuron aggregate is found (i.e. AS is found when the neuron is AS9).  A 2 is assigned if BOTH are found.

Additional neurons situated either within or in the vicinity of the nerve ring express the R13A1_4 reporter gene. In summary, R13A1_4 expression is neuron specific and restricted to about 45 cells. | [Expr3408] | [Expr7928] Expressed in more than 10 neurons but not ASE.		1	1	1	1														1			1					1	1	1													1	1	1	1																			1																														1	1		1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	2	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1

DEL-1	del-1 encodes an ion channel protein of the DEG/ENaC (degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel) family; like other members of the degenerin family, DEL-1 is predicted to function as a sensory mechanotransduction channel, however detailed analysis of the DEL-1 mutant phenotype has not yet been reported; DEL-1 is expressed postembryonically in the VA and VB motor neurons and in the FLP sensory neurons; the DEL-1 expression pattern overlaps that of UNC-8, an additional C. elegans degenerin involved in movement control, with which DEL-1 may coassemble to form mechanically activated cation channels.

Thus, del-1::GFP is not expressed in the VAs during the L2 period in which unc-4 functions in these cells to establish synaptic inputs but is expressed in the VAs after they have been wired into the ventral cord circuit. del-1::GFP is also expressed in five neurons (VB1, VB2, SABVR, SABVL, VA1) in the retrovesicular ganglion at the anterior end of the ventral nerve cord.
