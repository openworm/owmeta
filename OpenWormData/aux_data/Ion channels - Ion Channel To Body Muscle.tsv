Spreadsheet produced by S. Larson for OpenWorm (http://openworm.org).  Performs very basic text matching to discover statements that contain neuron names and abbreviations to begin to assign correspondance between channels and neurons.  Original source is WormBase expression pattern statements.  Not definitive in any way, but a starting point to produce this map.  More can be done to add classifications to neurons and to assign a relationship if the text mentions the class of the neuron instead of just the name or the abbreviation.  Need to do more spot checks and testing for bugs.

EGL-19	egl-19 encodes the pore-forming alpha1 subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel orthologous to the alpha subunit of mammalian L-type calcium ion channels; EGL-19 carries L-type currents in pharyngeal and body wall muscle, and its activity is essential and required for muscle contraction during late embryonic morphogenesis, locomotion, egg laying, mating and feeding; recordings of voltage-dependent calcium currents indicate that EGL-19 is the sole C. elegans alpha1 voltage-gated calcium channel subunit to carry currents in body wall muscle and that these currents are regulated by the CCB-1 beta subunit and the UNC-36 alpha2/delta subunit; egl-19 is expressed in muscle cells and some neurons.

KCNL-2	KCNN (potassium K ChaNNel, calcium activated)-Like	"neurons of the head and tail ganglia "	[Expr2023] Expression is seen in neurons of the head and tail ganglia predominantly in young larvae, but also evident in older larvae and adults. The number of neurons showing expression varies (probably due to mosaicism), but is typically 2 or 3 in the tail (but occasionally more, especially in young larvae) and 10-12 in the head.
