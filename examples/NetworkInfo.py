Get information about the network.

In this case, we are interested in a small set of neurons. We go through each of
the neurons and get connectivity information about each connection it has with
another cell.

This type of script could be useful for visualizing data, generating reports,
or any number programmatic applications in OpenWorm that involve connectivity.

Try running this script and see what it prints out. It takes a while to run
because there are so many connections, so feel free to comment out some of the
neuron names in the arbitrary list declared further below.
