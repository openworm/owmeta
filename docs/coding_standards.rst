========================================

Pull requests are *required* to follow the PEP8 Guidelines for contributions of
Python code to PyOpenWorm (with some exceptions). Compliance can be checked
with the ``pep8`` tool and these command line arguments::

    --max-line-length=120 --ignore=E261,E266,E265,E402,E121,E123,E126,E226,E24,E704

Some violations can be corrected with ``autopep8``.
