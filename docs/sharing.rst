Sharing Data with other users 
==============================

Sharing is key to |pow|. This document covers the appropriate way to share changes with other |pow| users.

The shared |pow| database is stored in a Git repository distinct from the |pow| source code. Currently the database is stored in a Github repository `here <https://github.com/mwatts15/OpenWormData>`_ .

When you create a database normally, it will be stored in a format which is opaque to humans. In order to share your database you have two options: You can share the scripts which are used to create your database or you can share a human-readable serialization of the database. The second option is better since it doesn't require re-running your script to use the generated data, but it is best to share both.

For sharing the serialization, you should first clone the repository linked above, read the current serialization into your database (see `below <#loading>`_ for an example of how you would do this), and then write out the serialization::
    
  import PyOpenWorm as P
  P.connect('path/to/your/config/file')
  P.config()['rdf.graph'].serialize('out.n3', format='n3')
  P.disconnect()

.. _loading:

Commit, your changes to the git repository, push to a fork of the repository on Github and submit a pull request on the main repository. If for some reason your are unwilling or unable to create a Github account, post to the `OpenWorm-discuss <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openworm-discuss>`_ mailing list with a patch on the main repository with your changes and someone will have a look, possibly ask for adjustments or justification for your addition, and ultimately merge the changes for you.

To read the database back in you would do something like::
    
  import PyOpenWorm as P
  P.connect('path/to/your/config/file')
  P.config()['rdf.graph'].parse('out.n3', format='n3')
  P.disconnect()

Scripts are also added to the repository on Github to the :file:`scripts` subdirectory.
